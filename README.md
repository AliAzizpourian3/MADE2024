# Analyzing the Effect of Population Growth on Temperature Changes

This project investigates the relationship between global population growth and temperature changes over the decades. By analyzing historical data, we aim to understand whether there is a connection between the increasing global population and the rising average temperatures. We will look at various factors such as population density, annual growth rates, and average surface temperature variations. Using data analysis and visualization, we seek to provide insights that could inform climate policies and strategies.

To get started, please follow these steps:
1. Create your own fork of this repository. Feel free to rename the repository right after creation, before you let the teaching instructors know your repository URL. **Do not rename the repository during the semester**.
2. Setup the exercise feedback by changing the exercise badge sources in the `README.md` file following the patter `![](https://byob.yarr.is/<github-user-name>/<github-repo>/score_ex<exercise-number>)`. 
For example, if your user is _myuser_ and your repo is _myrepo_, then update the badge for _exercise 1_ to `![](https://byob.yarr.is/myrepo/myuser/score_ex1)`. Proceed with the remaining badges accordingly.


## Project Report
For a detailed report on our findings and methodologies, please refer to the complete project report:
[Analysis-report.pdf](./project/analysis-report.pdf)
### Exporting a Jupyter Notebook
Jupyter Notebooks can be exported using `nbconvert` (`pip install nbconvert`). For example, to export the example notebook to html: `jupyter nbconvert --to html examples/final-report-example.ipynb --embed-images --output final-report.html`


## Exercises
During the semester you will need to complete exercises using [Jayvee](https://github.com/jvalue/jayvee). You **must** place your submission in the `exercises` folder in your repository and name them according to their number from one to five: `exercise<number from 1-5>.jv`.

In regular intervalls, exercises will be given as homework to complete during the semester. Details and deadlines will be discussed in the lecture, also see the [course schedule](https://made.uni1.de/). At the end of the semester, you will therefore have the following files in your repository:

1. `./exercises/exercise1.jv`
2. `./exercises/exercise2.jv`
3. `./exercises/exercise3.jv`
4. `./exercises/exercise4.jv`
5. `./exercises/exercise5.jv`

### Exercise Feedback
We provide automated exercise feedback using a GitHub action (that is defined in `.github/workflows/exercise-feedback.yml`). 

To view your exercise feedback, navigate to Actions -> Exercise Feedback in your repository.

The exercise feedback is executed whenever you make a change in files in the `exercise` folder and push your local changes to the repository on GitHub. To see the feedback, open the latest GitHub Action run, open the `exercise-feedback` job and `Exercise Feedback` step. You should see command line output that contains output like this:

```sh
Found exercises/exercise1.jv, executing model...
Found output file airports.sqlite, grading...
