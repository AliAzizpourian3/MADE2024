## Title
Analysing the Impact of Wage Levels on Health Insurance Coverage in the U.S.

## Main Question
1. Is there a correlation between wage levels and health insurance coverage rates across different demographics in the United States?

## Description
This project aims to analyse the relationship between wage levels and health insurance coverage in the United States. By exploring historical data on wages and health insurance coverage rates among various demographic groups, we seek to understand how income levels influence access to healthcare. The project will involve statistical analysis to evaluate correlations and identify trends that could inform socio-economic policies and strategies to improve healthcare access. Through this analysis, we aim to uncover insights into the role of income in determining healthcare coverage.
