# Project Plan

## Titla
Analyzing the effect of fossil CO2 emissions for all world countries on deaths from all Cancers
## Main Question

1. "Does the Impact of CO2 emission on the Global level Relate to Varied kinds of Cancer Death Across Countries?"

## Description
This project aims to explore the potential correlation between fossil CO2 emissions and cancer mortality rates worldwide. By examining data on CO2 emissions and cancer deaths across various countries, we intend to determine if higher levels of CO2 emissions are associated with increased cancer mortality rates. The analysis will involve statistical methods to assess the relationship between these variables, considering potential confounding factors. The ultimate goal is to understand if and how environmental factors like CO2 emissions influence public health, particularly cancer-related deaths.
